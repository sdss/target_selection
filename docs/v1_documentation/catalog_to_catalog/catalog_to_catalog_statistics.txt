There are 13 tables crossmatched in both version_id=21 and version_id=25 crossmatch runs:
['allwise', 'gaia_dr2_wd_sdss', 'glimpse', 'glimpse360', 'guvcat', 'kepler_input_10', 'legacy_survey_dr8', 'panstarrs1', 'sdss_dr13_photoobj_primary', 'tic_v8', 'tic_ ofv8_extended', 'tycho2', 'uvotssc1']


The first output table sandbox.catalog_ver25_to_ver31_full_all with all the catalogid pairs for each input table contains 189,151,494 entries

The final output table sandbox.catalog_ver25_to_ver31_full_unique with the list of unique pairs of catalogids contains 57,019,663 entries.
This table contains 51,525,427 unique lowest_catalogid's (version_id=25) and 56,508,221 unique highest_catalogid's (version_id=31)

The total number of version_id=25 catalogid's in the target table are 76,775,553 (one duplicated).
But from those 25,197,586 come from the catalog_to_skies_v2 table which means the number of non-sky version_id=25 catalogids in target are 51,577,967
Since no matched entry belongs to the catalog_to_skies_v2 table (confirmed) this means that 99.9% of the non-sky ver25 catalogids in the target table
were matched to ver31 catalogids and only 52,540 are not matched.

These non-matched non-sky v0.5 targets were stored in table sandbox.catalog_ver25_to_ver31_non_matched and file
/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/sdss50/sdsswork/sandbox/crossmatch/catalog_ver25_to_ver31_non_matched.csv which is also in this folder.
96.2% of them have lead='supercosmos' in the catalog table,

And the other lead values are  bhm_rm_v0, sdss_dr16_specobj, skymapper_dr2, bhm_csc, gaia_qso, and ps1_g18 (none of which were crossmatched in v1).
Table supercosmos was ingested in place 16 out of 24 in v0.5 crossmatch, which means stars with lead='supercosmos' are not present in any of the main 
tables and thus is probably not strange to not find them in v1.
